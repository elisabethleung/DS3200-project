We are both in section 4 

 The problems that our project is trying to solve are shown through these questions?  

- What animals are at each zoo?
- Who takes care of each area at the zoo? 

This is a problem because the animals in zoos internationally need to be kept track of and recorded for reproductive reasons. Who takes care of the animals is very important so others know how to contact them about having their respective animals reproduce. 

Our solution is that we created a Global Species database that links all the animals to what zoo they are in and then we linked the zoo to users. This way, users can see what other users are connected to zoos and can also see what animals are at each zoo. Each animal has it's name, sex, type, height, weight, age, species name, and speed listed for easier reproduction.

The typical user that would use our project is a zookeeper, animal curator, or anyone interested in any of the animals in captivity. They would use this to find animals of good fit to mate their animals with and/or find contact information to contact people for setting up mating.
